## Introduction
The Azure Search OpenAI Demo showcases various methods to integrate Azure Search with OpenAI models. This document outlines the backend approaches implemented in the demo.

## Approach 1: Keyword Search
Keyword Search is a traditional search method that matches user queries with indexed keywords in the documents. It is fast and efficient for straightforward queries but may not understand the context or intent behind the search terms.

### Features
- Simple implementation
- Fast query processing
- Limited understanding of context

## Approach 2: Semantic Search
Semantic Search leverages machine learning models to understand the meaning behind the user's query. It provides more relevant results by considering the context and intent.

### Features
- Context-aware search results
- Improved relevance
- Requires more computational resources

## Approach 3: Hybrid Search
Hybrid Search combines Keyword Search and Semantic Search to leverage the strengths of both approaches. It provides a balanced solution with improved relevance and performance.

### Features
- Combines keyword and semantic search
- Balanced performance and relevance
- More complex implementation

## Conclusion
Each search approach has its own advantages and trade-offs. The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. The Azure Search OpenAI Demo provides a practical example of how these approaches can be implemented and utilized.
